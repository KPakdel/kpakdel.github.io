# Managing Your Files Challenge

## Kian Pakdel
* I am in the iSchool's [Law Librarianship M.L.I.S. program.](https://ischool.uw.edu/programs/mlis/degree-options/law-librarianship)

* I am based in:![Seattle](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Arts/Downloads/Logo/Seattle_logo_landscape_blue-black.png)
* I am a horror buff with a particular interest in **plot-driven horror.** Too often, media tries to scare us with pacing and imagery, but nothing beats the horror of shows like _**The Twilight Zone**_ or short stories like _**I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream.**_
> I took this course because my program required it, but it seems like extremely useful information. I'm not sure how I would actually use web development skills on the job (legal reference librarianship), but it seems like it probably will come up at some point. I am unsure what to expect out of this course, but part of what I'm hoping to become comfortable with is tweaking HTML templates on blogging platforms like Blogger and Wordpress. 

### Addendum: 
    Examining your previous commits, I think the message for my last commit should have been something along the lines of "Updates README to include Kian's bio." I am updating the README with this addendum to demonstrate what is hopefully a better understanding of the commit message.

### Second Addendum
    Whoops, looks like I accidentally pasted what I intended to be the last commit message into the description instead (and it seems like editing previous commit messages is a bit of a challenge). This second addendum is intended to serve as damage control for the previous error... You learn more from making mistakes, right?
