# Portfolio, by Kian Pakdel

## About This Project
* I set out to design a portfolio of some of the design work I've done for libraries.
* I primarily used bootstrap for the visual organization. Referencing the Portfolio assignment and using bootstrap, I reconfigured some stuff, added a "jumbotron" title header, added a modal to the "contact" button, added pages to display different types of works with dropdown buttons providing more information, and implemented display changes for mobile screens. 
* I also added a slideshow of some works on the home page using Javascript. I later discovered I could have done something prettier in much less time with bootstrap, but I put in a ton of work figuring out how to make a slideshow with Javascript loops (complete with fading animations using CSS!) so I kept the Javascript slideshow in, hoping it would demonstrate to you a rudimentary understanding of the Javascript principles we covered in class. 
* I also added CSS  to animate buttons and the header icon while hovering.
